/*
 * SteelProgressionEngineTests
 *
 * Tests the core S.T.E.E.L. progression algorithm that determines:
 * - Set-to-set weight/rep adjustments based on performance ratings
 * - Bad-day detection when consecutive sets fail
 * - End-of-exercise decisions (increase, hold, or decrease weight)
 * - Next session starting weights with weekly caps
 * - Plate math for barbell exercises
 *
 * These tests ensure users progress safely and effectively without getting
 * injured from excessive weight increases or stalling from too-conservative programming.
