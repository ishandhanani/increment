## Important Instructions

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

## Python Development

See [PYTHON_DEV.md](./PYTHON_DEV.md) for Python-specific development guidelines using `uv`.
