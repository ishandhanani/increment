# Python Development Guidelines

# Tools

We use `uv` for all python related operations. Assume `uv` is installed.

## Working on new projects

```bash
# From the root of the repository run:
uv init hello-world
```

This creates a venv and a pyproject.toml file.

## Run code

```bash
# this will automatically run it in the venv
uv run main.py
```

## Dependencies

Use "uv add", "uv run", "uv sync", and "uv lock" for new projectsâ€”these manage dependencies via pyproject.toml and keep everything in sync. Use "uv pip" commands if you need pip-like flexibility or are working with legacy projects. Prefer project APIs for new work; use pip APIs for existing workflows.

## Working on individual scripts

When working on scripts or hacking things together quickly, please use inline dependency management.

```bash
uv add --script <name of script>.py 'pkgname1' 'pkgname2'
```
